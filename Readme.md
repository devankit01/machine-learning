# Data Science and Machine Learning 

## Introduction
This repository documents my learning  in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. I have been exploring various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to analyze and visualize data, perform data manipulation, and build machine learning models.

## Contents

1. [Pandas](#pandas)
2. [NumPy](#numpy)
3. [Matplotlib](#matplotlib)
4. [Scikit-learn](#scikit-learn)

## Pandas
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a powerful Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames and Series, which allow easy handling and manipulation of structured data.

### Topics Covered:
- Introduction to Pandas and its main data structures
- Loading and storing data with Pandas
- Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- Data filtering and selection
- Aggregation and Grouping
- Data merging and joining
- Handling missing data


## NumPy
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

### Topics Covered:
- Introduction to NumPy arrays and its attributes
- Array creation and manipulation
- Basic mathematical operations with NumPy arrays
- Array indexing and slicing
- vectorized operations
- Array shape manipulation
- Convert images to  numpy array


## Matplotlib
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a popular Python library used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a flexible and extensive set of plotting options to visualize data in various formats.

### Topics Covered:
- Introduction to Matplotlib and its various components
- Line plots, scatter plots, bar plots and Histograms
- Customizing plots: labels, titles, colors, etc.
- Subplots and multiple axes

## Scikit-learn
[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) is a comprehensive machine learning library in Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, making it an essential library for machine learning tasks.

### Topics Covered:
- Introduction to machine learning with Scikit-learn
- Supervised learning: classification and regression
- Unsupervised learning: clustering and dimensionality reduction
- Model evaluation and validation techniques
- Model tuning and hyperparameter optimization


## Conclusion
This repository serves as a record of my progress and learning in Data Science and Machine Learning using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. I will continue to update this documentation as I explore more topics and work on practical projects in the field of data science.
